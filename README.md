# airbitz-react-test
Sample ReactNative app using AirbitzCore

You will need React Native installed with Xcode and/or Android Studio to run the iOS/Android test apps.

See the docs at [airbitz-core-objc](https://github.com/Airbitz/airbitz-core-objc) on how to 
install the Airbitz React Native Javascript bindings. You will also need the [airbitz-core-java](https://github.com/Airbitz/airbitz-core-java) 
repo as well to install Android compatibility.

Once the app is run, test output is directed to the debugger console only. App GUI does not display any useful output at this time.
